# Updated Application - Changes Summary

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. **Separated Customer and Manufacturer Portals**
- ❌ Removed admin portal link from customer form
- ❌ Removed admin portal link from customer success page
- ✅ Portals are now completely independent
- Customer portal: `http://localhost:5000/`
- Manufacturer portal: `http://localhost:5000/admin`

### 2. **Simple Form-Based Manufacturer Configuration**
- ✅ Created `admin_config_simple.html` with standard HTML form inputs
- ✅ Replaced JSON textarea with individual input fields for:
  - Section configurations (3 sections)
  - Machine configurations (9 machines total)
  - Base costs for each machine
  - Default cost limit
- ✅ Form now shows **current saved values** in all fields
- ✅ Auto-generates costs for tasks 1-10 with 1.5% incremental variation

### 3. **Automatic Order Processing**
- ✅ Customer order submission now **automatically runs optimization**
- ✅ No manual "Process" button needed in admin dashboard
- ✅ Results are immediately available to manufacturer
- ✅ Order status shows: Processing → Processed/Failed
- ✅ Failed orders show error message

### 4. **Persistent Manufacturer Configuration**
- ✅ Manufacturer saves configuration once
- ✅ Configuration is automatically used for all new orders
- ✅ Each order gets a snapshot copy of current manufacturer config
- ✅ Manufacturer can update config anytime
- ✅ Previous orders retain their original configuration

### 5. **Enhanced Data Loading**
- ✅ Config form loads and displays current values from saved CSVs
- ✅ Machine data indexed by (section_id, machine_id) for easy lookup
- ✅ Base costs extracted from task 1 entries
- ✅ Default cost limit loaded from `config.json`

2. **templates/customer_form.html**
   - Removed admin portal navigation link

3. **templates/customer_success.html**
   - Updated message text
   - Removed admin portal reference

4. **templates/admin_dashboard.html**
   - Removed manual "Process" button
   - Shows automatic processing status
   - Updated messaging about automation

5. **templates/admin_config_simple.html** (NEW)
   - Simple HTML form replacing JSON textareas
   - All fields show current saved values
   - Clear labels and organized sections

## 🔄 New Workflow

### Customer Submits Order:
1. Customer fills form at `http://localhost:5000/`
2. Uploads CAD files
3. Clicks "Submit Order"
4. **System automatically:**
   - Saves customer data
   - Copies manufacturer config
   - Runs optimization
   - Saves results
5. Customer sees success message with Order ID
6. Customer **does not** see results

### Manufacturer Views Results:
1. Manufacturer opens `http://localhost:5000/admin`
2. Sees all orders with status (Processed/Processing/Failed)
3. Clicks "View Results" for any processed order
4. Sees full optimization output:
   - Chosen section
   - Profit breakdown
   - Production time
   - Task assignments
5. Can download JSON/CSV reports

### Manufacturer Updates Configuration:
1. Manufacturer clicks "Manage Manufacturer Configuration"
2. Form shows **all current values**
3. Updates any values needed
4. Clicks "Save Configuration"
5. New configuration used for all future orders
6. Old orders keep their original configuration

## 🎯 Key Benefits

✅ **Separated Interfaces**: Customer and manufacturer portals are completely independent  
✅ **Simple Configuration**: No JSON editing - just fill in form fields  
✅ **Current Values Visible**: See what's currently configured before updating  
✅ **Automatic Processing**: Orders processed instantly when submitted  
✅ **Persistent Config**: Set once, use for all orders  
✅ **Historical Integrity**: Each order preserves its configuration snapshot  
✅ **Error Handling**: Failed optimizations marked clearly  

## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup:
```powershell
# Start the application (if not already running)
cd d:\project\sazol_sir_schdl
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
```

### Configure Manufacturer Data (One Time):
1. Open: http://localhost:5000/admin
2. Click: "Manage Manufacturer Configuration"
3. Review pre-filled default values
4. Update as needed (form shows current values)
5. Save configuration

### Customer Order Flow:
1. Customer opens: http://localhost:5000/
2. Fills form and uploads files
3. Submits order
4. Gets Order ID confirmation
5. Done - optimization runs automatically

### Manufacturer View Results:
1. Open: http://localhost:5000/admin
2. See all orders with status
3. Click "View Results" on any processed order
4. Download reports if needed

## 📝 Technical Notes

- **Cost Generation**: Base costs auto-expand to 10 tasks with 1.5% increments
- **Machine Indexing**: Config uses `(section_id, machine_id)` tuples for fast lookup
- **Error Handling**: Failed optimizations saved with error message
- **File Structure**: Each order gets isolated folder with all inputs/outputs
- **Core Logic**: Solver module (`solver.py`) remains completely unchanged

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Saved in `data/` folder:
- `sections.csv` - Section configurations
- `machines.csv` - Machine configurations  
- `costs.csv` - Variable costs (auto-generated for tasks 1-10)
- `times.csv` - Task-specific times (empty by default)
- `config.json` - Default cost limit and metadata

### Each order folder contains:
- `customer_data.json` - Customer submission
- `params.csv` - Order parameters
- `sections.csv` - Snapshot of manufacturer config
- `machines.csv` - Snapshot of manufacturer config
- `costs.csv` - Snapshot of manufacturer config
- `solution_summary.json` - Optimization results
- `solution_assignments.csv` - Task assignments
- Uploaded CAD and document files

All changes maintain the original optimization logic without modification.
