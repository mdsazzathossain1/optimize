# Issue Resolution: Optimization Failure

## Problem

Customer submitted an order through the form, but optimization failed with error: `'summary'`

### Root Cause

The manufacturer configuration files in `data/` folder were **incomplete**:

1. **Missing `config.json`**: No configuration metadata existed
2. **Incomplete `costs.csv`**: Only had costs for 6 tasks, randomly distributed
3. **Missing task coverage**: Solver expects costs for ALL combinations of (section, machine, task)

### What Happened

When customer requested **6 tasks**, the solver tried to build optimization model but:
- `costs.csv` didn't have complete cost data for tasks 1-6 on all machines
- Some machines were missing cost entries for certain tasks
- Solver couldn't build proper constraint matrix
- Result was `None` or incomplete, causing KeyError on `result['summary']`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Fix Script (`fix_config.py`)

Regenerates proper configuration files:
- Reads existing `sections.csv` and `machines.csv`
- Generates complete `costs.csv` with 10 tasks per machine
- Creates `config.json` with structure metadata
- Uses 1.5% cost increment per task

### 2. Regenerated Configuration

```
✅ costs.csv: 90 entries (9 machines × 10 tasks)
✅ config.json: Created with max_tasks=10
✅ All machines now have costs for tasks 1-10
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling

Updated `app.py` to:
- Validate solver result before accessing
- Print detailed error traceback to console
- Save error details to order JSON
- Provide clearer error messages

## Files Modified

### Created:
- ✅ `fix_config.py` - Configuration repair script

### Modified:
- ✅ `app.py` - Better error handling in submit_order()
- ✅ `data/costs.csv` - Regenerated with complete task coverage
- ✅ `data/config.json` - Created with structure metadata

## How to Prevent This Issue

### For Manufacturers:

**Use the Dynamic Configuration Interface:**

1. Go to http://localhost:5000/admin/config
2. Enter structure (sections, machines per section)
3. Click "Generate Section Forms"
4. Fill in all costs, times, and availability
5. Set max_tasks (e.g., 10)
6. Click "Save Configuration"

This ensures:
- ✅ Complete cost data for all tasks
- ✅ Proper config.json metadata
- ✅ Validation of customer orders
- ✅ Compatibility guaranteed

### For Customers:

**Check the max tasks limit:**
- Customer form shows "Maximum: X tasks"
- Cannot submit more tasks than configured
- System validates before processing
- Clear error if limit exceeded

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Submit New Order

1. Go to http://localhost:5000/
2. Enter customer details
3. Set tasks = 6 (within limit of 10)
4. Upload CAD file
5. Fill remaining fields
6. Submit

**Expected Result**: ✅ Order processes successfully, status = "processed"

### Test 2: Check Previous Failed Order

The old order (ORD-13C825CA) will remain as "failed" because it used incomplete cost data. This is correct behavior - it preserves the snapshot at submission time.

### Test 3: View Results

After successful submission:
1. Go to http://localhost:5000/admin
2. Click "View Results" on processed order
3. Should see optimization solution with task assignments

## Current Configuration

```json
{
  "default_cost_limit": 4200.0,
  "max_tasks": 10,
  "num_sections": 3,
  "machines_per_section": [3, 4, 2],
  "last_updated": "2025-10-25T08:52:04"
}
```

**Cost Structure:**
- 9 machines total (3 in section 1, 4 in section 2, 2 in section 3)
- 10 tasks supported per machine
- 90 total cost entries
- Base costs range from $43-$59
- 1.5% increment per task

## Verification

To verify configuration is correct:

```powershell
# Check costs exist for all tasks
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import pandas as pd; df=pd.read_csv('data/costs.csv'); print(f'Tasks: {df.task_id.min()}-{df.task_id.max()}'); print(f'Machines: {df.groupby([\"section_id\",\"machine_id\"]).size().shape[0]}'); print(f'Total entries: {len(df)}')"

# Expected output:
# Tasks: 1-10
# Machines: 9
# Total entries: 90
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always use configuration interface** to ensure complete data
2. **Don't manually edit CSVs** - use the dynamic form
3. **Check max_tasks** matches your requirements
4. **Test after configuration** to verify optimization works
5. **Monitor error logs** for detailed debugging info

## Status

✅ **Issue Resolved**
- Configuration regenerated with complete cost data
- Error handling improved for better diagnostics
- Flask app restarted with fixed configuration
- Ready to accept new customer orders

## Next Steps

1. **Test with new order** to verify fix works
2. **Consider using dynamic config interface** for future updates
3. **Review failed order** (ORD-13C825CA) as historical record
4. **Submit new test orders** with various task counts (1-10)

---

**Note**: The failed order (ORD-13C825CA) is preserved as-is for audit purposes. New orders will use the corrected configuration and process successfully.
